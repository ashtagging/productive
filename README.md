# Productive 

Hello and Welcome to The README for Productive

Productive is a productivity tool that allows users to make themselves more productive.

Productive includes:
 - A To-do List
 - Calculator
 - Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer and Calculator are both projects from FreeCodeCamp which I have included in this project, the code pens I have created with the tests passing can be found at:

Pomodoro Timer (25+5 Timer): https://codepen.io/ashtagging/pen/JjLaqKQ
Calculator: https://codepen.io/ashtagging/pen/dymmOOe

React Router DOM was used to navigate through the pages and Sass was used to style the application

**A Journal on creating this app can be found at**
