# Productivity App

"This application takes 3 commonly built basic applications a Calculator, Pomodoro Timer and To do list and combines them all into one application. React Router DOM was used to navigate through the pages and Sass was used to style the application"

"The main challanges from this project came from the pomodoro timer notably getting the sound to work when the timer reached 00:00 and letting the user to set  different break and start times"
